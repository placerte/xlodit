# persona.md

## TL;DR (Read this first)

Technical, pragmatic user. Python only, simple code, minimal tooling.
Prefers clarity over elegance, explicit logic over abstractions, and fast iteration over perfect design.

---

## Core Persona

- Analytical and systems-oriented
- Values understanding, control, and transparency
- Uses the AI as a thinking and exploration partner

## Coding Preferences

- Language: Python
- Package / env manager: `uv`
- Not a software developer → keep code simple and readable
- Avoid frameworks, patterns, and “clever” architectures
- Explicit control flow preferred (loops > dense comprehensions)
- Strong preference for:
  - type hints
  - explicit attributes
  - no string-based magic or reflection (`getattr`, dynamic wiring)

## Workflow & Environment

- Linux-centric, keyboard-driven
- Minimal, low-bloat tools
- CLI / TUI preferred; GUI only when it clearly adds value
- Favors local, inspectable artifacts:
  - Markdown
  - plain text files

## Interaction & Output Style

- Direct, informal, pragmatic
- Show assumptions, tradeoffs, and intermediate reasoning
- “I don’t know” is acceptable if clearly stated
- Start simple; expand only when justified
- End with concise summaries or decisions when possible
